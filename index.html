This to practise and try out new features of HTML and CSS. The new features I implemented with this website was the use of SASS to compile my CSS and flexbox to practice a new method of laying out content. Clicking this text will take you to the website to review my entire resume.</a></p>

                <p class="portfolio--about"><a class="multAppUrl" href="https://bensenica.github.io/multipage-application/index.html" target="_blank">For our Multipage Application challenge we had to rebuild the existing website of Battlenet World of Warcraft as close as possible with all skills we learned for HTML and CSS thusfar. The website had to be build out of multiple pages. This way we learned to make a navigation bar. Not all links in the navigation bar had to work. The only pages we had to reconstruct where the index page, news page, and settings (the ...). Clicking the link in the navigation bar brings you to the corresponding page. For this page I used grid to layout the entire website. Thanks to this challenge I found out that using CSS grid makes it very easy to layout a website and it became my go-to when laying out.</a></p>

                <p class="portfolio--about"><a class="cdcUrl" href="https://bensenica.github.io/bts-becode/" target="_blank">The Client Challenge had two objectives. Firstly teaching us to work with a client who would come pitch what he/she needed and have little access to the client afterwards for further questions. Taking correct notes was of the utmost importance and simultaneously think of beter alternatives. I made some parts of this challenge twice. The first draft was what the client asked for, the second draft was how I tought it would be best. This way the client could see both drafts and then decide what suits his needs best. Secondly we had to work in teams of four to finish this project. This proved to be a challenge. Getting all of our teammates on the same page and preventing them from going rogue was a real challenge in itself. I acted as a project leader on this challenge to keep things going forward and remind them to first make the draft as requested by the client and afterwards make a draft where they could portray their own ideas.</a></p>

                <p class="portfolio--about"><a class="cinemaUrl" href="https://bensenica.github.io/responsive-cinema/" target="_blank">This challenge was to teach us the importance of responsive webdesign. The goal was making a website for a movie theater. Using media queries I made the website responsive for mobile phones, tablets and desktop/laptop users. Desktop/laptop users would get a four column tabel where the movies that are currently on display are shown. This tabel would change the smaller the viewing screen gets. Tablet users would get a 2-3 column tabel and mobile phone users would get all the movies beneath each other. The navigation bar would for mobile users changes from a horizontal list to a vertical list.</a></p>

                <p class="portfolio--about"><a class="rpgUrl" href="https://bensenica.github.io/js-rpg/" target="_blank">As a final Javascript test we had to create our own game. The game pits two players together in a turnbased versus-based game. We where given some basic rules that the game should require. The game had to have 3 actions the players can chose from. Attack, heal or yield. There had to be four different races that all have their own benefits. Besides the races, there are four different items the players can pick. Again each having its own strenghts. Besides those basic rules I added a way to determine who gets to act first. I did this by making the code simulate a coin flip. Based on that result, the actions of either player 1 or player 2 would be disabled. After preforming an action, the other players action buttons would be enabled while disabeling the acting players buttons. I implemented this as an anti-cheat feature.</a></p>
